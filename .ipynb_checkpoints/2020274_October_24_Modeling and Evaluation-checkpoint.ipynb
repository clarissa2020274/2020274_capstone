    "# Project Title: Coffee Price Prediction Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook aims to analyze historical coffee price indices and develop a predictive model for future price trends. The focus is on using data from the ICO (International Coffee Organization), particularly indices like I-CIP, Colombian Milds, Other Milds, Brazilian Naturals, and Robustas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives:\n",
    "1. Clean and preprocess the dataset for missing values and inconsistencies.\n",
    "2. Explore the time-series behavior of coffee prices through visualizations.\n",
    "3. Implement various forecasting models to predict future price trends.\n",
    "4. Compare model performance using key metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset:\n",
    "The dataset used in this analysis consists of historical coffee price data, with daily observations for business days. Prices are expressed in cents of USD.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools & Libraries:\n",
    "- **Python**: For data manipulation and model building.\n",
    "- **Pandas**: For data handling and preprocessing.\n",
    "- **Matplotlib & Plotly**: For visualizations.\n",
    "- **Scikit-learn & Statsmodels**: For predictive modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Outcome:\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, we will identify the best forecasting model for coffee prices and present actionable insights based on the findings."
